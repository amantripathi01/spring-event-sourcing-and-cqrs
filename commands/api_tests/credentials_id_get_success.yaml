# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: The API key is exposed in the header of the HTTP request, which can be a potential security risk if the logs are not properly secured. This is found in the log lines containing 'token': '{{apiKey}}'.
# Solution: Consider removing sensitive information such as API keys from the logs. If this is not possible, ensure that the logging mechanism is secured and that only authorized individuals have access to the logs. Also, consider rotating the API keys regularly.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: Detailed error messages are being logged. This can provide an attacker with additional information about the system. The error messages are found in the log lines containing '"error":"error/code","description":"Descriptive Error Message"'.
# Solution: Avoid logging detailed error messages, especially those that might reveal information about the system's architecture, configuration, or security measures. If detailed logs are necessary for debugging, ensure they are only accessible to authorized users.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
# Issue: The host and port are being exposed in the logs ('host':'localhost:4012'). This could potentially reveal network configuration information to an attacker.
# Solution: Avoid logging host and port information, especially for production systems. If this information is necessary for debugging, ensure that the logs are secured and only accessible to authorized users.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check for Standard
# Issue: The logs do not show any evidence of data encryption, which could lead to GDPR violations if PII or PCI is involved.
# Solution: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit. Implement regular audits to ensure compliance with GDPR and other relevant standards.
