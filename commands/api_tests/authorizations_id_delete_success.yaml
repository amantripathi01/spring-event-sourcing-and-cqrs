# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
# Issue: The API token is exposed in the header of the HTTP request. This is a security risk as it can be used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the system.
# Solution: Never log sensitive information such as API tokens. If required for debugging, make sure to mask or encrypt such information.
# 
# Vulnerability: Verbose error message
# Issue: The error message in the HTTP response is very descriptive. This could potentially give attackers insights into the system.
# Solution: Error messages should not reveal any sensitive information about the system. They should be generic and not give away any details that can be used by an attacker.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential GDPR violation
# Issue: The logs contain a UUID which might be related to a user's personal identifiable information (PII). This could potentially be a violation of GDPR.
# Solution: Logs should never contain PII. If user identification is necessary for debugging, consider using a system that can map the PII to a non-identifiable value.
