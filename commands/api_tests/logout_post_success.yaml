# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
# Issue: API token is exposed in the headers of the HTTP request at line 2. This is sensitive information that should not be exposed.
# Solution: Remove sensitive information from log files. Use secure methods to store and access sensitive data like API tokens.
# 
# Vulnerability: Software version exposure
# Issue: Software version is exposed in the headers of the HTTP response at line 3. This information can be used by attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities in this version.
# Solution: Remove software version information from response headers. Regularly update software to the latest version to avoid known vulnerabilities.
# 
# Vulnerability: Unencrypted data transmission
# Issue: Data is being sent unencrypted as seen in the HTTP request at line 2. This exposes the data to potential interception and misuse.
# Solution: Use secure methods like SSL/TLS to encrypt data during transmission.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential PII exposure
# Issue: The host information in the HTTP request at line 2 could potentially include PII if the host is a user's personal device.
# Solution: Avoid logging host information or anonymize it to prevent potential PII exposure.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR non-compliance
# Issue: The logs do not show any evidence of encryption being used. This could lead to GDPR non-compliance if any personal data is being processed or stored.
# Solution: Implement encryption for all personal data to comply with GDPR. Additionally, ensure that all processing of personal data is done with the user's consent and is necessary for the provision of the service.
