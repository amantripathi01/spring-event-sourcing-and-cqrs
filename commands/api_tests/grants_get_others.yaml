# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: An API token is exposed in the header of the HTTP request at line 1, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
# Solution: Remove sensitive data like API tokens from the logs. Implement a method to mask or obfuscate such critical information in the logs.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information (PPI)
# Issue: The log contains personal identifiable information (PII) including email addresses at line 1, which is a violation of GDPR principles.
# Solution: Implement a method to mask or obfuscate PII in the logs. Ensure that no PII is logged, and review data handling practices to ensure GDPR compliance.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: The log contains detailed HTTP response information at line 1. If this includes error messages, it could expose system details or lead to further attacks.
# Solution: Implement a custom error handling mechanism that catches and handles errors without revealing system information in the logs.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
# Issue: The log contains a base64 encoded image at line 1, potentially exposing sensitive information.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive data. Implement a mechanism to filter out such data from the logs.
