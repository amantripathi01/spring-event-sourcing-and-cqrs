# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: The error message in the log reveals that the system has a route that doesn't have a matching method. This could expose system details to potential attackers. The issue is found in the line: '[HTTP SERVER] get /authorizations âœ–  error     Request terminated with error: https://stoplight.io/prism/errors#NO_METHOD_MATCHED_ERROR: Route resolved, but no method matched'
# Solution: Avoid exposing system details through error messages. Instead, use custom error pages or messages, and log the detailed error internally for debugging.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: The log exposes a token which can be sensitive information. The issue is found in the line: 'header':  {'accept':'application/json','token':'{{apiKey}}',...}
# Solution: Ensure sensitive data such as tokens are redacted or anonymized in the logs. Consider using a secure way to store and access sensitive information.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: The log exposes the 'user-agent' and 'host' details. These can be used to identify the client and server configurations, potentially leading to targeted attacks. The issue is found in the line: 'header':  {...,'user-agent':'PostmanRuntime/7.32.3',...,'host':'localhost:4012',...}
# Solution: Avoid logging full 'user-agent' and 'host' details. If these details are necessary for debugging, consider storing them in a separate, secure log accessible only to authorized personnel.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-compliance
# Issue: The log does not appear to be anonymizing or pseudonymizing user data which could potentially lead to GDPR non-compliance.
# Solution: Ensure all logs are processed in a way that complies with GDPR. This includes anonymizing or pseudonymizing user data and not storing unnecessary data.
