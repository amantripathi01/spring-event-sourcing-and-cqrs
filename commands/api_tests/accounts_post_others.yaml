# Vulnerability: Exposed email addresses
# Issue: Email addresses are being logged in plaintext. This can be found in each of the log entries.
# Solution: Avoid logging personal identifiable information (PII) such as email addresses in plaintext. If it is necessary to log such information for debugging or audit purposes, ensure that the logs are properly anonymized or pseudonymized according to GDPR guidelines.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential API token exposure
# Issue: The 'postman-token' in the headers could potentially be an exposed API token. This can be found in each of the log entries.
# Solution: Do not log API tokens or any other form of credentials. If it is necessary to log them for debugging, ensure that they are obfuscated or encrypted in the logs.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure HTTP Headers
# Issue: The 'commit-hash' in the headers could potentially reveal sensitive information about the version or state of the application. This can be found in each of the log entries.
# Solution: Avoid exposing unnecessary information in HTTP headers that could provide hints about the internal workings of the application. If it is necessary to include such information in the headers, ensure that it is not sensitive or revealing.
