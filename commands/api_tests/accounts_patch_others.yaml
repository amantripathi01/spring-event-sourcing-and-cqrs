# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
# Issue: Email addresses are being logged, which is a form of Personal Identifiable Information (PII). This can be seen in the body of the PATCH requests to '/accounts'.
# Solution: Avoid logging PII information. If it is necessary, ensure it is anonymized and encrypted to prevent exposure. Implement a strict data handling policy for GDPR compliance.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
# Issue: The logging of 'postman-token' in the headers could potentially expose sensitive information. If these tokens are not rotated frequently, they may be used by an unauthorized actor to gain access.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive data like authentication tokens. If logging is necessary, ensure they are anonymized or encrypted. Implement a token rotation policy.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: The server is providing verbose HTTP responses. This can provide an attacker with valuable information about the internal workings of the server.
# Solution: Limit the information provided in HTTP responses. Do not reveal unnecessary details about the system architecture or functioning.
