# Vulnerability: PII Exposure
# Issue: Email address is exposed in the log in plain text format. This is a potential GDPR compliance issue. Issue is found at the line: 'body: ' {'client':'api','email':'a0'ISs.%1g?.x-at.j723*UaY6ce.6.k6s.uKO2guSZr#1.GQxmrg@[106.6.528.947]','otp':'<string>'}
# Solution: Ensure to redact or encrypt all PII data in the logs. Implement a logging solution that automatically redacts sensitive information.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Communication
# Issue: The logs show that the server is using HTTP for communication instead of HTTPS. This could expose sensitive data to potential eavesdropping. Issue is found at the line: 'POST       http://0.0.0.0:4010/login'
# Solution: Configure the server to use HTTPS for all communications. This will ensure that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and secure.
# 
# Vulnerability: Hardcoded Sensitive Information
# Issue: Postman token is exposed in the log in plain text format. This could potentially be exploited to impersonate the user. Issue is found at the line: 'postman-token':'39d50e1f-0b14-4f31-b3b9-a3112c6413bf'
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as tokens. If necessary, ensure it is encrypted or hashed.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Configuration
# Issue: The server is configured to accept connections from any host ('host':'localhost:4012'). This could potentially allow unauthorized access to the server.
# Solution: Restrict the server to only accept connections from trusted hosts or networks. Implement proper network access control lists (ACLs).
