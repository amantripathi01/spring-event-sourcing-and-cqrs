# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
# Issue: Email addresses are being logged and exposed in the request body. This could lead to a breach of GDPR if the logs are not properly secured.
# Solution: Avoid logging PII such as email addresses. If it is necessary, ensure that logs are stored securely and access is strictly controlled.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
# Issue: Sensitive access tokens (postman-token) are being logged and exposed in the request headers. This could potentially allow an attacker to reuse the tokens for unauthorized access.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive authentication tokens. If it is necessary to log them for debugging purposes, ensure that the logs are encrypted and stored securely with restricted access.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
# Issue: The logs do not appear to be encrypted, potentially exposing sensitive information if the logs are accessed by unauthorized individuals.
# Solution: Encrypt log files to ensure that any sensitive information within them cannot be read by unauthorized individuals.
