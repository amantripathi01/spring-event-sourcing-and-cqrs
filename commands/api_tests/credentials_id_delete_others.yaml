# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
# Issue: API token is exposed in headers of the request. This is a potential security risk as it can be exploited by attackers.
# Solution: Remove the sensitive information from the logs. Tokens or any sensitive information should be masked or removed entirely from the logs, especially if they are going to be shared or stored.
# 
# Vulnerability: Verbose Error Message
# Issue: The error message in the response is too verbose and could reveal potential system vulnerabilities or sensitive information.
# Solution: Error messages should be generic and not disclose any system internals or sensitive information. They should be logged on server side and a unique error number should be given to the client instead of detailed message.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential PII Exposure
# Issue: UUID in the DELETE request could potentially be a PII if it's directly related to a user.
# Solution: Ensure that UUID is not directly linked to a user. If it is, anonymize or pseudonymize it before logging.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Network Protocol
# Issue: Connection is made using HTTP, which is not secure and can expose data to potential eavesdropping.
# Solution: Use HTTPS for secure communication over a computer network.
# 
# Vulnerability: Software Version Disclosure
# Issue: The API version is disclosed in the response headers. This could help an attacker identify potential security vulnerabilities related to specific versions.
# Solution: Remove software version information from the response headers.
