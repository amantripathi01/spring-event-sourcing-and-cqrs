# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Potential verbose error message
# Issue: Error messages may be revealing potential system vulnerabilities or sensitive information. This can be observed in the HTTP responses that contains 'error' and 'description' fields.
# Solution: Error messages should be generic and not reveal any sensitive system information. Detailed errors can be logged internally for debugging but should not be exposed in the API responses.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential exposure of API token
# Issue: API tokens are included in the headers of HTTP requests. These tokens can be potentially exposed in the logs.
# Solution: Ensure that sensitive information like API tokens are not logged. Implement a log masking mechanism to mask sensitive information in the logs.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential exposure of software version
# Issue: Software version is included in the headers of HTTP responses. This can potentially help an attacker to identify known vulnerabilities of the software version.
# Solution: Remove software versions from the response headers or logs. Keep software up-to-date to minimize known vulnerabilities.
