# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
# Issue: The API token is exposed in the header of the HTTP request. This is a security risk as it can be used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the system.
# Solution: Never log sensitive information such as API tokens. If required for debugging, make sure to mask or obfuscate sensitive parts.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
# Issue: UUID in the URL can lead to IDOR if not properly validated. An attacker could manipulate references to gain unauthorized access to data.
# Solution: Always validate and ensure proper access control checks are in place before performing actions on an object.
# 
# Vulnerability: Verbose Error Messages
# Issue: The error message returned by the server reveal too much information about the system. This can be leveraged by an attacker to understand the system and device potential attack vectors.
# Solution: Ensure error messages are generic and do not reveal any system information. Detailed errors can be logged internally for debugging.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-compliance
# Issue: If any of the request or response data contains user personal information, it may be in violation of GDPR compliance.
# Solution: Ensure no PII (Personal Identifiable Information) is logged. If required, make sure it is anonymized or pseudonymized.
# 
# Vulnerability: Software Version Disclosure
# Issue: The API version is disclosed in the headers. This can be used by an attacker to exploit known vulnerabilities of that version.
# Solution: Avoid exposing software versions. If required for functionality, ensure any known vulnerabilities in the exposed version are patched.
