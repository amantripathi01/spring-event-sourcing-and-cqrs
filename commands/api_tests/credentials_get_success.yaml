# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: The logs contain API tokens which are sensitive data. The token is located in the 'header' section of the HTTP request.
# Solution: API tokens should not be logged. Implement a filter to remove or obfuscate sensitive data before logging.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: The logs contain HTTP response body that includes error messages. These could potentially give away system vulnerabilities or sensitive information.
# Solution: Ensure that error messages are generic and do not reveal any details about the underlying system or data.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Log File
# Issue: The logs contain requests to '/credentials' endpoint which could potentially expose sensitive information if not handled correctly.
# Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted or obfuscated before logging. Also, review the access controls and encryption measures for the log files.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
# Issue: The logs contain GET requests with query strings which could potentially expose sensitive information.
# Solution: Avoid logging full URLs with query strings. If necessary, implement a filter to remove or obfuscate sensitive data before logging.
