# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: API token is visible in the logs. This is sensitive information and should not be logged. Found in the header section of the request.
# Solution: Remove sensitive data from logs. Consider using a secure method for storing and accessing API tokens. Implement a logging policy that excludes sensitive information.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: Detailed HTTP response is logged. If an error occurs, it could potentially reveal system information.
# Solution: Implement an error handling mechanism that catches errors and sanitizes the information before logging. Do not log full HTTP responses.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Compliance: PII Exposure
# Issue: Email address is visible in the logs. This is Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and should not be logged. Found in the body of the response.
# Solution: Remove PII from logs. Implement a logging policy that excludes PII. Encrypt PII when stored and mask when displayed.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
# Issue: User-Agent and host are logged. This information can be used in an attack.
# Solution: Limit the logging of unnecessary information. Only log information that is necessary for debugging and auditing purposes.
