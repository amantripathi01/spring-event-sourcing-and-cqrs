# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Potential Exposure of PII
# Issue: An email address is logged in the request body (line 1) and response body (line 2). This could be a violation of GDPR if the data is not properly anonymized or pseudonymized.
# Solution: Remove or pseudonymize PII from logs. Ensure that any necessary logging of PII complies with GDPR requirements.
# 
# Vulnerability: Hardcoded Tokens
# Issue: A Postman token is present in the request header (line 1). If this token is hardcoded and not properly secured, it can pose a security risk.
# Solution: Replace hardcoded tokens with secure methods of token generation and renewal. Ensure tokens are securely stored and not logged.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential Exposure of Sensitive Information
# Issue: The response header includes a location attribute (line 2) which might contain sensitive information about the server's internal file structure.
# Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information in response headers. Review logging practices to ensure that sensitive information is not inadvertently logged.
# 
# Vulnerability: Software Version Exposure
# Issue: The API version is exposed in the response header (line 2). This can potentially aid an attacker in identifying known vulnerabilities of the specific API version.
# Solution: Avoid exposing software version information in response headers or error messages. Regularly update software to the latest version.
