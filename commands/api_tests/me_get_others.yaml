# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Exposed Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
# Issue: Email address 'user@example.com' is exposed in the HTTP response body, line 2
# Solution: Ensure PII such as email addresses are encrypted or masked in logs and responses to maintain privacy and comply with GDPR regulations
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Headers
# Issue: API token is exposed in the HTTP request header, line 3
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive header information like tokens. Implement secure mechanisms for handling tokens like using HttpOnly cookies
# 
# Vulnerability: Information Disclosure
# Issue: Server and software details are being exposed in the logs, line 3
# Solution: Configure server to prevent disclosure of software versions, server details, and other information that could aid an attacker
# 
# Vulnerability: Lack of Data Encryption
# Issue: Data in the HTTP response body (line 2) and request header (line 3) is not encrypted
# Solution: Implement encryption mechanisms to protect data in transit and at rest. Use HTTPS for secure communication
