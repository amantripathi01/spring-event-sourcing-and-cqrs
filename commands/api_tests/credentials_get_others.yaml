# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: The logs are revealing potentially sensitive information like the API key and Postman token in the header of the request. This exposure could allow an attacker to use these credentials to impersonate a legitimate user or exploit the API.
# Solution: Ensure that all sensitive information is redacted or encrypted before being logged. Implement a centralized logging mechanism that can filter out sensitive data.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Error Message Information Leak
# Issue: The logs are showing detailed error messages that could reveal system vulnerabilities or sensitive information to an attacker. For instance, the log shows a 400 status code with a descriptive error message.
# Solution: Error messages should not reveal any specific details about the software system or its state. They should be generic and not give away any information that could be useful to an attacker.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files
# Issue: The logs are showing the hostname and port number of the server. This information could be used by an attacker to perform targeted attacks.
# Solution: Avoid logging hostnames or port numbers. If necessary, ensure that logs are stored securely and access is strictly controlled.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-Compliance
# Issue: If any of the logged information includes personally identifiable information (PII) or payment card information (PCI), it would be a violation of GDPR. The logs provided do not show any obvious PII or PCI, but without knowing the purpose of the API key, it is impossible to be sure.
# Solution: Ensure that no PII or PCI is logged. If PII or PCI must be logged for some reason, it must be encrypted and access to the logs must be controlled and audited.
