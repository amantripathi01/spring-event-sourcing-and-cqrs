# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
# Issue: API token is exposed in headers of the request. This is a security risk as it can be used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to the system.
# Solution: Never log sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, etc. If it's necessary to log such details for debugging, ensure the logs are properly sanitized before storing. Use a secure way to store and access API keys.
# 
# Vulnerability: Verbose Error Message
# Issue: The error message in the HTTP response is too descriptive and might reveal system information or hints about the system's inner workings.
# Solution: Avoid detailed error messages that might reveal system information. Use generic error messages for the end users and log the detailed error internally for debugging.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR Non-Compliance
# Issue: The logs seem to contain user-specific data which may violate GDPR principles.
# Solution: Ensure logs do not contain any personally identifiable information (PII) to stay GDPR compliant. If necessary, anonymize the data before logging.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
# Issue: A direct object reference is found in the DELETE request. This can be exploited if proper access controls are not in place.
# Solution: Ensure that proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access. Rather than using direct references, use indirect references where possible.
