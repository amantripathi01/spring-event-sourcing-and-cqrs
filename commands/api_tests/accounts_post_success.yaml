# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Email Exposure
# Issue: Emails are exposed in the logs, which is a form of Personal Identifiable Information (PII). This is a GDPR compliance issue. The emails are found in the body of the POST requests to '/accounts'.
# Solution: Sensitive information such as emails should not be logged. If required, mask or encrypt the sensitive parts of the data before logging.
# 
# Vulnerability: API Version Disclosure
# Issue: API version '1.0.0' is disclosed in the response headers. This could potentially provide valuable information to an attacker about potential system vulnerabilities.
# Solution: Avoid exposing unnecessary information such as API versions in response headers.
# 
# Vulnerability: Commit Hash Exposure
# Issue: Commit hash '928d28d' is exposed in the response headers. This can reveal specific versions of the codebase and potentially expose the system to vulnerabilities if the commit history is publicly accessible.
# Solution: Avoid exposing unnecessary information such as commit hashes in response headers.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Content Type
# Issue: Insecure content type 'application/json' is used in the request headers. It is possible to perform cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks with this content type.
# Solution: Use more secure content types like 'application/json+antixsrf'.
# 
# Vulnerability: Exposure of User Agent
# Issue: User agent 'PostmanRuntime/7.32.3' is exposed in the request headers. This information could be useful for an attacker to target specific known vulnerabilities of the user agent.
# Solution: Avoid logging user agents or any other information that might help an attacker identify specific software versions or types.
# 
# Vulnerability: Exposure of Postman Token
# Issue: Postman token is exposed in the request headers. This token can be used to authenticate and execute any Postman request, leading to potential security risks.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as authentication or access tokens.
