# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
# Issue: API token is exposed in the headers of the HTTP request at line: 2
# Solution: Use secure methods to store and transmit sensitive data like API tokens. Consider implementing encryption for sensitive data and use HTTPS for data transmission.
# 
# Vulnerability: Software version disclosure
# Issue: API version is exposed in the headers of the HTTP response at line: 3
# Solution: Remove software version information from the response headers to prevent potential attackers from identifying known vulnerabilities associated with specific versions.
# 
# Vulnerability: Unencrypted data transmission
# Issue: HTTP request and response data are transmitted in plaintext at line: 2 and 3
# Solution: Implement HTTPS to encrypt data during transmission. This will protect the data from being read or modified while in transit.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
# Issue: User-Agent data is exposed at line: 2
# Solution: Avoid exposing internal implementation objects (like files, database records, etc.) to users. Use a index, map, or other indirect method.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential GDPR non-compliance
# Issue: User-Agent data, which can potentially be used to identify a user, is exposed at line: 2
# Solution: Ensure all personal data is handled in accordance with GDPR regulations. This includes obtaining user consent for data collection and providing clear information about how, where, and why user data is stored and processed.
