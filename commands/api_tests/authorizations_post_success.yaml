# Vulnerability: Potential Exposure of PII
# Issue: An email address is included in the HTTP request body (line 1).
# Solution: Ensure that email addresses, which qualify as PII, are properly protected and not unnecessarily logged. Consider using anonymization or pseudonymization techniques where possible.

# Vulnerability: Potential Exposure of PII
# Issue: An email address is included in the HTTP response body (line 2).
# Solution: Ensure that email addresses, which qualify as PII, are properly protected and not unnecessarily logged. Consider using anonymization or pseudonymization techniques where possible.
# 
# Vulnerability: Exposure of API tokens
# Issue: An API token is included in the HTTP request header (line 1).
# Solution: API tokens should not be logged in clear text. Consider using a secure vault to store sensitive data, and ensure all logs are sanitized of sensitive information before being stored.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure HTTP Method
# Issue: The HTTP method POST is used for the /authorizations endpoint (line 1 & 3).
# Solution: Ensure that the HTTP method used for sensitive actions is secure. If this endpoint is used for creating new authorizations, consider using a more secure method such as PUT.
# 
# Vulnerability: Inadequate Content Security Policy
# Issue: The HTTP response header does not include a Content Security Policy (line 2).
# Solution: Implement a Content Security Policy to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other cross-site injections.
