# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
# Issue: An API token is exposed in the header of the HTTP request at line 1, which could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system.
# Solution: Remove sensitive data like API tokens from the logs. Implement a method to mask or obfuscate such data.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
# Issue: The detailed HTTP response at line 2 contains potentially sensitive information about the system's internal workings that could be useful to an attacker.
# Solution: Reduce the verbosity of the HTTP response messages in the logs. Only include essential information.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information (PPI)
# Issue: Personal Identifiable Information (PII), such as email address, is exposed at line 2 in the HTTP response body.
# Solution: Avoid logging PII or use anonymization techniques to ensure privacy. Regularly audit the logs for PII and remove it.
# 
# Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information Into Log File
# Issue: The logs contain sensitive data in the form of API tokens and PII, which are exposed at lines 1 and 2 respectively.
# Solution: Implement a logging policy that excludes sensitive data. Use a logging tool that supports the automatic exclusion or masking of such data.
# 
# Vulnerability: GDPR non-compliance
# Issue: The logs contain PII, which is a violation of GDPR principles.
# Solution: Ensure that no PII is logged, or if it is necessary, that it is anonymized. Implement strict access controls for the logs and store them securely.
