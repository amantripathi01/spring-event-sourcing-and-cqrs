# ================================VULNERABILITIES================================
# Vulnerability: PII Exposure
# Issue: Email address is exposed in the log in plain text format. This is a potential GDPR compliance issue.
# Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information such as email addresses. If necessary, mask or anonymize the data before logging.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Content Type
# Issue: The 'content-type' header in the request is set to 'application/json', which is not a secure content type.
# Solution: Consider using a more secure content type like 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.
# 
# Vulnerability: Insecure Token Generation
# Issue: The system is using a potentially insecure method to generate tokens (postman-token). This can expose the system to token prediction attacks.
# Solution: Use a secure method to generate tokens, such as a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
# 
# Vulnerability: Exposure of Internal Server Details
# Issue: The logs are revealing internal server details like host and port number (localhost:4012). This can be exploited by attackers to gain more information about the internal network.
# Solution: Avoid logging internal server details. If necessary, mask or anonymize the data before logging.
# 
# Vulnerability: Potential Brute Force Attack
# Issue: Multiple POST requests to /login endpoint might indicate a brute force attack.
# Solution: Implement rate limiting and account lockout policies to prevent brute force attacks.
